The goal of the manuscript was to test a panel of genetic markers to evaluate the genetic diversity across the mammal community in two different national parks: Do√±ana National Park (Spain) and Kinabalu National Park (Malaysia). We further used the genetic data for phylogenetic reconstructions of the Rattini.

The phylogenetic analysis were done using complete [mitochondrial genomes](mitogenomes) and a panel of nuclear markers, mainly introns:
+ mitochondrial genomes: fasta files are [here](mitogenomes/tree-reconstruction/mitogenomes.fasta). The code used for annotating the mitochondrial genomes is [here](mitogenomes/tree-reconstruction/readme.md). The analysis resulted in one tree for complete [mitogenomes](mitogenomes/tree-reconstruction/raxml/RAxML_bipartitions.mitogenomes) and another one for [cytochrome b](mitogenomes/tree-reconstruction/cytb/raxml/RAxML_bipartitions.cytb).
+ nuclear markers: a species tree was reconstructed from gene trees using Astral. The fasta files are [here](data/raw/fasta). The code is in [src](src). Intermediate files are [here](intermediate), and final tree with Astral is [Astral](intermediate/astral/output).
